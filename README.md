# Prodigi Frontend Assignment

* *Assignment*: Create a custom select component or control in the framework of your choosing.*

The user should be able to select only a maximum of one option at a time, but the control should also allow for a no selection state. Demonstrate the use of this control by creating a settings page that takes input configuration JSON and generates a list of setting entries based on this.

## Considerations

* Design the application in a way that would make it easy to extend it with different types of settings (for example checkboxes / color picker entries etc.).

* The frontend needs to fetch the JSON from the server. A mockapi endpoint has been provided for convenience: http://5c3ef0e3c27832001404e2ac.mockapi.io/settings

* Tools such as create-react-app or angular-cli can be used for easy bootstrapping.
